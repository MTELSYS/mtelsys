    <span>
      Studying electrical engineering is by no means easy, that is at least the experience of many student at MTELSYS.
      However, there are certain tools one can utilise to make these courses a little less painful, and a little more fun.
      Using these tools, developed by current &mdash; or previous &mdash; students, you can put your focus where it needs to be, instead of refactoring your python script for plotting data from Analog Discovery 2 in ESDA, or sampling for an ADC in TTT4280.

      MTELSYS &mdash; formally known as Electronics Systems Design and Innovation &mdash; is a five-year integrated masters programme at NTNU, Trondheim.
      Completing the degree grants you the protected title of "Sivilingeni√∏r" in Norway, and is a highly sought after degree in the industry.
      Students may choose to specialise in a variety of fields, such as acoustics, analogue circuit design and radio, embedded systems, nano electronics and photonics, space systems and signal processing.
